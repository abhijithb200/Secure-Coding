## Difference b/w docker and VM

- VM create a complete virtualized operating system environment, including a guest operating system and virtualized hardware layer that emulates physical hardware

- Docker create lightweight and portable environments for running applications. It shares the same host operating system, but it has its own isolated file system, network interfaces and process space. Docker run on the same host operating system, but on its own isolated environment.
